concurrent application to search file from "/" (root) by it's name 

to run: ```make``` to compile library 

```make main``` ```chmod +x main``` to compile and make app executable

 ```sudo ./main``` to launch app

 ```./main``` to run search

 (consider that using 'sudo' may be dangerous for your system as it gives superuser privileges to executable, but searching without sudo no yet have been implemented in this app, so you don't have a choice if want app to run ```:)```)
